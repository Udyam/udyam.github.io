<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p style=" text-align: left">Engineers are the pioneers in implementation of scientific principles and technological innovations in the real world. The event is going to be two fold. In the first round one has to simulate the behavior of the system and then in second round one has to design the given system in the real world. The real world system design would allow the participants to deal with the problems encountered during the design process at first hand and on the other hand, Simulation forms the interconnecting bridge between laboratory research and field reality. Udyam provides a golden opportunity to young technocrats to deal with challenging issues of the industry by providing solutions using simulation tools like Matlab, Pspice, Proteus, MultiSIM etc.
</p>
<h2>
Problem Statement:
</h2>
<p style=" text-align: left">
In this event you will make a basic calculator model.<br>
Consider an algebraic equation consisting of 3 operands(4 bit each) and 2 operators(2 bit each).<br>
Your task is to store the operands and operators and implement the equation following BODMAS rule.
<br>The operators can include addition,subtraction,multiplication,division.<br>
<b style="font-size: .8em">Note: Use of direct ICs for ADDER and MULTIPLIER are allowed. Use only TTL74 series ICs. Output to be considered in 8 bit unsigned format.</b>
</p>
<h2>
Event Structure:
</h2>
<p style=" text-align: left">
One team can consist of max. 4 members.<br>
only those who have successfully cleared 1st round can proceed to 2nd round.<br>
Your solution will also be tested on the spot by the judges.<br>
You might be asked to implement some of the equations in order to test the proficiency of your solution.
</p>
<h2>
Judging Criteria:
</h2>
<p style=" text-align: left">
The event consists of 2 rounds: <br>
<b>Round 1: Simulation round</b>
you are required to implement the ps in Proteus.<br>
Marking depends on efficiency and optimization of the simulation.<br>
<b>Round 2: Hardware round</b>
The teams that successfully pass simulation round will be required to implement their design on hardware during UDYAM. <br>
Your success will depend on how successfully they are able to implement the design on hardware.<br>
<b>* Extra points for innovation. Eg. sign extended numbers, divide by zero situation etc.</b>
</p>
