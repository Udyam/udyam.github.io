<h2>Introduction</h2>
<b style="font-size: 1.5em; color: black;"> Prof. B. B. Bansal Memorial RASPI Innovation event </b><br>
<p style=" text-align: left">Amongst the many surprises that UDYAM'16 unfolds is this new event on Raspberry Pie.Participants will get to know certain basics of computer science through a series of credit-card Sized single-board computers.
</p>
<h2>
Problem Statement:
</h2>
<p style=" text-align: left">
Among the submitted entries we will be picking the top 5 ideas and providing the respective teams with a Raspberry Pi to build their prototype. There would be a waiting list of another 3 abstracts who will be awarded with first refusal in case any of the other teams withdraws.
Furthermore, if any abstract is not picked in either of the lists, the team is still eligible to enter the competition but they will have to arrange a Raspberry Pi on their own. These participants will be equally eligible to win prizes as the selected entries.
During the event the teams will be judged by an esteemed panel on the criteria mentioned below and top three will be awarded cash prizes.

</p>
<h2>
Event Structure:
</h2>
<p style=" text-align: left">
A team can consist of at the most 5 members. You can submit your abstracts to coordinators by 15 Jan. Top five teams shall be selected and notified by 18 Jan. They shall have their final event, during Udyam, on 14 Feb.<br>
All shortlisted teams will get to keep their Raspberry Pis. Apart from that, top 3 teams will get exciting cash prizes!
</p>
<h2>
Judging Criteria:
</h2>
<p style=" text-align: left">
* Teams using any open data sources in their solutions / proposals will score higher in judging.<br>
* Teams developing a solution that helps people with disabilities will score higher in judging.<br>
* Teams are free to add additional sensors or components to their basic kits.
* Original ideas are expected. However, it is acceptable to mash up a few different things to create a new solution. As Newton said, “I stand on the shoulder of giants”. However, copying an existing solution as is is not appreciated or acceptable. Teams doing so will be disqualified (Remember: judges have access to the same search engine that you used to find the idea to copy in the first place)
